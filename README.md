## Description
In a world where mystical creatures live alongside humans, a boy and his phoenix companion take a stroll in the nearby hills. However, their walk is shockingly interrupted by a volcano eruption. The phoenix, being immune to the lava, sets out to help the boy get back to safety - through the forest and across many rivers. To do so, the phoenix must utilise his special abilities: regenerative tears, and destructive fire breath.

## Why?
During the global pandemic lockdown, Falmouth University Games Academy hosted a two month long game jam, with the theme of 'Phoenix'. This project was my submission for said game jam. I took this as an opportunity to use isometric 2d maps for the first time, which I enjoyed experimenting with and can see myself using again in the future.
